# Daily Algorithm Practice

A repository dedicated to solving algorithms daily, following the [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) roadmap for foundational algorithms.

## 📋 About

This repository contains my daily algorithm practice solutions implemented in JavaScript. I'm following the NeetCode roadmap to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, starting with the essential problems.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve at least one algorithm problem daily
- Follow the NeetCode roadmap systematically
- Improve problem-solving skills and coding proficiency
- Build a comprehensive collection of well-documented solutions
- Don't use AI to solving an algorithm but use to learn about a data structure

## 📝 Solution Format

Each solution file includes:

- Problem description and link
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Approach explanation
- Clean code
- Test cases

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions and improvements are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
